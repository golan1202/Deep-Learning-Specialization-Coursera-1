# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
### [Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

This is an excellent course, probably the best MOOC on Deep learning on the Internet today (based on my experience with multiple courses on this topic). The course requires basic understanding of Machine Learning concepts. Prof. Andrew Ng hand holds you as a beginner but drops you in the water through the journey until you are well versed with the nity grities of theoretical and practical aspects of Deep Learning.

These are my submissions required for completion of the course. If you are taking this course, I suggest you access this repo only to look for alternative implementations.
